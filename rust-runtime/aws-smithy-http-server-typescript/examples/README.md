# Smithy Rust/Typescript Server SDK example

This folder contains an example service called Pok√©mon Service used to showcase
the service framework Typescript bindings capabilities and to run benchmarks.

The Python implementation of the service can be found inside
[pokemon_service.ts](/rust-runtime/aws-smithy-http-typescript-server/examples/pokemon_service.ts).

## Depedencies

TODO: Add NAPI installation instructions

## Build

Since this example requires both the server and client SDK to be code-generated
from their [model](/codegen-server-test/model/pokemon.smithy), a Makefile is
provided to build and run the service. Just run `make build` to prepare the first
build.

Once the example has been built successfully the first time, idiomatic `cargo`
can be used directly.

`make distclean` can be used for a complete cleanup of all artefacts.

## Test

`cargo test` can be used to spawn the Python service and run some simple integration
tests against it.

More info can be found in the `tests` folder of `pokemon-service-test` package.
